# Erdap Mtg with Karin
# upwell.pfeg and coastwatch.pfeg
# coastwatch curated by us / more reliable probs
# mur SST best sst kine stuff

# each has dataset ID to pick it
# recommended to use .nc file download

# RECO: Roms is only california current
# Hycom is global
# seapodym ?

# Datasets have different global ranges, time ranges, etc. May have it look
# at your data/needs and suggest some?
# Roms/CCSRA is a UCSC product, not available on erdap
# oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu    31yr reanalysys is really good

# Either give me an .nc file or i can go read shit off erdap if you really want me to
